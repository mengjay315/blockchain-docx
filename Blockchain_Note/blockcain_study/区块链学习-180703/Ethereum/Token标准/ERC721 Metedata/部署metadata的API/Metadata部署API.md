# Deploying your metadata API

You're welcome to deploy your metadata API however you see fit: you can host it on IPFS, cloud storage, or your own servers. To get you started, we've created two simple sample API servers in Python and NodeJS that serve metadata for OpenSea creatures:

- [Python example API server](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-python)
- [NodeJS example API server](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-nodejs)
