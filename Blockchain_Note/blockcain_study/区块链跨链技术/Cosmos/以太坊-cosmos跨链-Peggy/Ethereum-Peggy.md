## Peggy

Interestingly enough, the Peg-Zone also allows users to send any token that lives on Cosmos to the Ethereum chain (the Cosmos tokens would be represented as ERC20 on the Ethereum chain). The Tendermint team is currently working on a **Peg-Zone implementation for the Ethereum chain called [Peggy**](https://github.com/cosmos/peggy).
